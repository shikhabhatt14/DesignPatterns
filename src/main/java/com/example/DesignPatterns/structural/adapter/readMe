Adapter Design Pattern
======================

The Adapter Design Pattern is a structural pattern that allows objects with
incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two
incompatible interfaces, enabling them to communicate and function together
seamlessly.

In this pattern, an adapter class is created that implements the target
interface and holds a reference to an instance of the adaptee class (the
class with the incompatible interface). The adapter translates the requests
from the target interface into calls to the adaptee's methods, allowing the
target interface to work with the adaptee's methods without requiring any
modifications to the adaptee class.
