Strategy Pattern
The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm's behavior at runtime. It defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. This pattern lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
It is particularly useful when you have multiple algorithms for a specific task and want to choose one at runtime based on the context or user input.
Advantages:
1. **Flexibility**: You can change the algorithm used by the context at runtime.
2. **Encapsulation**: Each algorithm is encapsulated in its own class, making it easier to manage and maintain.
3. **Open/Closed Principle**: You can add new algorithms without modifying existing code.
4. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each algorithm has its own class, adhering to the single responsibility principle.
5. **Testability**: Each strategy can be tested independently.
6. **Reusability**: Strategies can be reused across different contexts.
7. **Separation of Concerns**: The context is separated from the algorithms, making the code cleaner and easier to understand.
Disadvantages:
1. **Increased Complexity**: The number of classes can increase, making the system more complex.
2. **Communication Overhead**: The context must be aware of the strategy interface, which can lead to tight coupling.
3. **Difficulty in Choosing the Right Strategy**: If there are many strategies, it can be challenging to choose the right one at runtime.
4. **Overhead of Strategy Creation**: Creating a new strategy object can add overhead, especially if the strategy is lightweight.
5. **Potential for Code Duplication**: If multiple strategies share common code, it can lead to code duplication unless properly managed.
